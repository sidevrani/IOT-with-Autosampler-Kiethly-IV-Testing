# IOT-with-Autosampler-Kiethly-IV-Testing

These are the documents describing the system where in a Robotic Autosampler arm is integrated with IV Keithely picoamperemeter as well as a Fluorescence counter (Excitation & Emission wavelengths  493/546  & 517/567 nm,respectively)  and made to capture the real time data for processing in the data pipeline in the project with Peptide Nanopores Test Automation Pipeline with IV/ Fluorescense. Accompanying videos namely provide the physical demos of the working of Bio-Sensei.
